#### About the program:
We have created a narrative between a couple. It is a tragic materialistic love story between the hopeful Endor and the ungrateful Phin. Phin is obsessed with the thought of the perfect diamond ring and Endor canâ€™t afford to give what Phin expect to get.

We have constructed the code as the narrative and choose to visualize the symbol of materialism in this story; the diamond ring. We have written the narrative as a code regularly could look like with variables, if statements and logical operators. Simply by looking at the program in the browser, you would have no idea what the story is about. You have to research and look into what the code really means.

We decided to do the assignment this way, because we thought it was a interesting twist to e-literature. By creating something simple, as a diamond ring, visual and then actually writing the story as a manuscript, makes the meaning of e-literature stand out. To make the storytelling come alive we added sound files to play along while reading the dialog. Rasmus mixed snips from different songs/clips and made it into one sound file. We found it interesting to mix music genres with different meanings, and make it seem like it belonged together.

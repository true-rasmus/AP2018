Touch screen recommended :) 


#### about the program:
inspired by the PRT CHR - I wanted to make a generative program that slowly fills the canvas with shapes and colors... yet I wanted the user of the program to have at least a bit of control... or to at least be able to have some amount of impact of how the shapes a drawn.
My program calculates (every frame) a chance to either draw one of two possible shapes and sets of color values. The behaviours changes depending on where the user positions the mouse (or finger, if touch/mousePad input) aswell as when the x-value exceeds the width of the canvas.

The code is actually pretty simple and i've added comments in the .js if you want to study it.


### Generativity

Who or what is in control? can artistry really be choreographed?
I've consider myself an artist in many ways and i've always considered my expressions to be valid in the artform I work with. Some people agree and some disagree. Taste and bias will forever have a toll on the personal relationship with consuming creativity. I guess i'm trying to explain... that artistry is a superposition. It's there, but it's not there - untill it's defined. At some point these randomly generated strokes will become something more.

Now, there is no rule stating that something has to be considered art or not. But I find it very interesting to try and pinpoint when you, yourself, consider something to be art. Personally i consider something as art the second i see (or hear) something different than the face value. 
But it's weird, i don't follow that logic when it comes to authorship... 
Authorship is like a stated fact. THIS GUY HERE MADE THIS. But an author (in many ways just like the artist) manipulates something, in order to create. The alphabet if you write novels. The 12-tone system if you write western music. The colors and qualities of the brush if you paint. In more basic terms, these are tools for creating. So the author is the user? conductor? or choreographer? no matter what, the artistry would not have been authored without him/her, so in that sense it's perfectly reasonable to consider him the 'true' author. Well, in my program the code is kinda the choreographer.. the codes sets the rules. You, the user, is but a tool. So do I (or the p5's java-script) author the painting you generate with my program? Following the previous logic, it would be understandable to say so.. but while the aesthetics are partly coded, it's the user and his/her judgement that determines the outcome. just like most artforms.

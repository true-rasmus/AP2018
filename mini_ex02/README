Basicly a generic post00's dance track with the possibily to add or remove animal sounds.

USE MOUSE TO ADD/REMOVE SOUNDS
!! - i did not add a big enough window for touch-controls. it works - but is buggy as f*ck. Mouse or MousePad recommended.

TURN ON SOUND
!! - for some reason the first 8 bar-loop plays at a higher volume.

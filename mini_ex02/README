Basicly a generic post10's dance track with the possibily to add or remove animal sounds.

USE MOUSE TO ADD/REMOVE SOUNDS
!! - i did not add a big enough window for touch-controls. it works - but is buggy as f*ck. Mouse or MousePad recommended.

TURN ON SOUND
!! - for some reason the first 8 bar-loop plays at a higher volume.

making the program:

i had some troubles getting control of the box that hightlights which fader you're interacting with. when the mouseXY wasn't around 
a certain fader anymore, it didn't remove the box, just drew more when a new fader was selected. i learned that placing the background
in the draw function prevented this, as the background is equally drawn every frame.
i played around with the basic sound options. loading, volume, looping. they are axtually very simple to work. volume and other audio 
qualities work as variables which makes that easy to manipulate through functions - and is definititly something i want to dive further into.


initially i drew a piano out of shapes but i ended up in another direction. i drew lines and squares to represent a mixer and thought it
would be fun to make each 'fader' in the mixer turn on and off a bunch of animal sounds. because the representation of the mixer turned 
out so basic and stupid i made some basic and stupid music to go along with it. I guess the notion of fun is a sort of stupid-fun - as in,
there is nothing deeper going on. it just sounds stupid - but somehow hilarious at the same time, when you add enough animals to the track.
